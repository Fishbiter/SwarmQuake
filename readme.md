Disclaimer:

This readme written after at least 2 years of non-development activity - so expect the unexpected.

If your machine suffers massive breakdown while it's running SwarmQuake - that's your problem.

Getting Started
---------------

It's really very simple.

i) Unzip the archive to a subdirectory of your main Quake dir (x).
ii) Start the game using -game x

eg.

extract to c:\Quake\Swarm
c:\quake\quake -game swarm

iii) Start a deathmatch game.
iv) Kill monsters until they kill you.
v) Repeat step iv until boredom kills you...


Other Features
--------------

Your guess is as good as mine... Looking over the source I see you can bind "zeroscores" in multiplayer (they are automatically zeroed if there's only one player in the game). Erm... Who knows?
